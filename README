This repository contains scripts used to investigate the quality of Trinity transcriptome assemblies.

The files "analysis.py" and "assemble_evaluate.py" are the two main scripts containing most of the logic.
The Shell script "run_analysis" is used to submit an analysis batch to a computer cluster using the Slurm Workload Manager.
